# METADATA

Metadata defined according to the OME-XML (Open Microscopy Environment Schemas)
https://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/

## How are extracted

Manually the OME-XML is copy+pasted manually from full stacks via Fiji, thus the metadata files contain additional planes, and possibly time points depending on the file. See the correspondence below:

![alt text](https://github.com/petteriTeikari/vesselNN_dataset/blob/master/metadata/table.png "How substacks are sliced from original full acquisitions")

## To fix

* missing metadata from "santos2015_mixedSizelowContrastVessels.xml" and "santos2015_lowContrastVessels_metadata.xml" which are from the same original .oib acquisition. Settings are similar to "santos2015_tumor_metadata.xml"
